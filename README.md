**Markdown Interface & Live Formatter**

MILF is a lightweight, cross-platform Markdown viewer and editor for Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## Status

Early development, but already usable day-to-day. The split-pane workspace, file open/save, view modes, theming, and auto-save are working today. Specs for shipped and in-progress features live under [`specs/`](specs); open issues and follow-ups are in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/lezli01/milf/issues).

## Features

- **Live split-pane preview.** Edit Markdown on the left, see it rendered on the right, with each pane scrolling independently.
- **Three view modes.** Editor-only, preview-only, or side-by-side — switch at any time without losing the editor's content, selection, or undo history.
- **Light and dark theme.** Honors the operating system's appearance preference by default, with a manual toggle in the toolbar.
- **Open files from disk.** Native file picker biased toward `.md` and `.markdown`, with a fallback to all files.
- **Save back to disk.** Manual Save plus a visible modified indicator next to the file name so you always know whether your edits are on disk.
- **Optional auto-save.** Tick the box once and edits land on disk shortly after you stop typing, while a file is open.
- **Active-file header.** The current file name (or `Untitled`) sits at the top of the workspace; full path is one hover away.
- **Persistent preferences.** Theme, view mode, and auto-save choice are remembered between launches, stored locally.
- **Responsive layout.** Side-by-side on a normal window, stacks vertically at narrow widths.
- **Safe preview.** Rendered HTML is sanitized with DOMPurify before display.

## Quick start

Prerequisites: Node.js LTS, npm, Rust + Cargo, and Tauri 2's [platform prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for your OS.

Install dependencies:

```sh
npm ci
```

Launch the desktop app:

```sh
npm run tauri dev
```

Or run just the frontend in a browser:

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Development checks

Frontend:

```sh
npm run lint
npm run build
```

Rust / Tauri (from `src-tauri/`):

```sh
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo check --all-targets --all-features
```

## Project layout

```
src/             React + TypeScript UI (editor, preview, workspace, toolbar)
src-tauri/       Rust crate that hosts the Tauri desktop runtime
specs/           Feature specifications (one folder per feature)
docs/            Architecture notes and supporting docs
```

## How we work

MILF is spec-driven: every meaningful feature begins with a short spec under [`specs/`](specs) before implementation, with acceptance criteria the work has to meet. See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full issue-to-PR workflow and the checks expected before a pull request.

## Privacy

MILF is local-first. Files stay on your machine and the application does not send your content over the network. Preferences are stored in the local browser storage of the desktop runtime.

## Security

Please do not open public issues for suspected vulnerabilities. See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).
